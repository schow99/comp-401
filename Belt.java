 * The Belt interface represents the belt in a sushi restaurant upon which

 * 
 * Positions on the belt are nominally numbered from 0 to size-1 but any integer
 * can be interpreted as a valid position as follows:
 * 
 * If a position value greater than size-1 is used, it should be understood as
 * having wrapped around back to the beginning of the belt. In other words, using
 * the value size as a position is the same as using the value 0, size+1 is the
 * same as the value 1, and so on. 
 * 
 * Similarly, negative values for positions are understood as having wrapped around
 * to the end of the belt. So the value -1 as a position is the same as using size-1, -2
 * the same as size-2, etc.
